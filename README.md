# SPC GUI: Statistical Process Control for Gamma Passing Rate Data


> Version: 1.0.0 ‚Äì August 2025

**SPC_GUI** is a Python-based GUI application (also available as a Windows executable) for performing Statistical Process Control (SPC) on Gamma Passing Rate (GPR) data. Developed as a research tool for analyzing and exploring SPC methods in radiotherapy QA, it supports both standard and heuristic approaches, allows interactive outlier detection and elimination, and exports analysis results as CSV files and PDF charts.

## üìå Features

- Load data from `.xlsx`, `.xls`, or `.csv` files using a predefined template.
- Once loaded:
  - The data is automatically sorted by QA date.
  - A preview of the loaded dataset is shown, along with a summary of which data entries are selected for analysis.
  - Basic descriptive statistics are calculated for selected Gamma metrics.
  - Histograms can be generated to visualize data distributions.
  - The Anderson-Darling test can be performed to assess normality.
- SPC Analysis (core functionality):
  - Choose one of four SPC methods:
    - Shewhart I - Control Charts (for normally distributed data)
    - Weighted Standard Deviation (WSD) I - Control Charts
    - Scaled Weighted Variance (SWV) I - Control Charts
    - Skewness Correction (SC) I - Control Charts
  - Detect and visualize outliers on control charts.
  - Use the interactive elimination loop to remove selected outliers and recalculate control and specification limits in real-time.
- Export results:
  - PDF files with SPC charts and histograms.
  - CSV files containing normality test results, summary statistics, and elimination logs.

## üéØ Who Should Use This?

- Researchers and academics working on QA processes or SPC techniques in radiotherapy
- Medical physicists analyzing Gamma Passing Rate (GPR) data
- Students and scientists studying applied statistics or quality control in medical physics

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use the App

### Option 1: Run the Executable (Windows)

If you're using Windows, an installable `.exe` version is available.

- Download the installer from the [Releases](#-releases) section.
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Once installed, you can launch the SPC GUI from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

---

### Option 2: Run from Python Source (cross-platform)

Ensure Python 3 is installed. Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AEvgeneia/SPC_GUI_Scientific_Tool.git
cd SPC_GUI_Scientific_Tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
python SPC_GUI.py
```

## üì¶ Releases

You can find the latest installable Windows executable in the [Releases section](https://github.com/AEvgeneia/SPC_GUI_Scientific_Tool/releases) of this repository.

## üìÇ Input File Format

Your input file must follow a specific format with required columns:
- ID
- Site of cancer
- QA Date
- One or more GPR columns (e.g., `Global 3%2mm`, `Global 2%2mm`, `Local 3%3mm`, etc.)

If you want to perform SPC on the **mean gamma (Œ≥)** value, the column `MedianDoseDev` is also required.

A sample Excel template is available in the `example_data/` folder:
`input_example/template.xlsx`

- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## üì§ Output

- **On-screen display**:
  - Interactive GUI showing loaded data, statistical summaries, histograms, normality test results, and SPC I-Charts.
  - Options to select metrics, run different SPC methods, and eliminate outliers.
  - All plots are displayed live within the GUI.

- **Exports**:
  - CSV files with summaries of SPC statistics, normality test results, and outlier elimination logs.
  - PDF files containing all selected plots (SPC I-charts and histograms).
